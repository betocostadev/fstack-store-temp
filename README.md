# Fstack-Store-Template

Where you can go shopping, but you can't buy anything. After all, if you don't buy, the discount is 100%.

## Description

This repository was created as a template for an online store using the following stack:

**Front-end:**

- React
- Next.js
- Apollo Client
- Styled Components

**Back-end:**

- Node
- Keystone.js
- Mongo DB

Most of this code is based on the course [Advanced JS & GraphQL](https://advancedreact.com/) by [Wes Bos](https://wesbos.com/).
Wes is great teacher and have many other courses in his website. If you want to learn about all the stack used in this project, I recommend that you check his course.

Since the material is a bit old, it will not work with `Node 18+`. It was developed using `Node 16.13.0`
